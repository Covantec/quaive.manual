Library
=======

The Library in Quaive is where content for all users of the intrant is stored. Unlike workspaces, which are usually restricted to a certain group of users, the Libray is available to all.

------------------------------
Viewing content in the Library
------------------------------

To access the Library, simply click the Library link in the main navigation area of your Quaive site. Contents in the library can be organised in hierarchies - that means folders and sub-folders.

In order to provide a good overview, the Library shows two levels of contents at the same time. When you open the library, you will see a view like this. For every main section, you see a little box with the section's title, and below the titles of the sub-sections.

Grouped by section
------------------

By default, the contents inside the library are displayed by section and sub-section (i.e. folders and sub-folders). Clicking on one of the main sections shows you a little box for each sub-section. Inside the boxes, you have direct access to the documents they contain.

If a document inside the Library is meant for download (such as a Word file, spreadsheet, etc), a click on a document will cause your browser to download it. If a document can be viewed in the browser, a click on it will open the detail view of it, for example:

Grouped by tag
--------------

In Quaive, all contents can be tagged with keywords. This also applies to the Library. To view the Library contents grouped by the tags they were assigned, simply change the grouping in the little selector below the top navigation:

Similar to the display by section, you then see two levels, placed in little boxes. Each box shows the all documents that match your selected tag, under the heading of an additional tag that the document carries.
