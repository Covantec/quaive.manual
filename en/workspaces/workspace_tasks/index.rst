Tasks
==================

This part of the manual is about how to use and create tasks in an existing workspace.

In a workspace in Quaive, you can use tasks to define small pieces of work and assign this to another user.
Tasks can be closed when the job is finished and reopened again if this seems necessary.
A notification email is sent out to the different users when a task was edited or it's status was changed.
