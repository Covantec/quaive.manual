Manage Workspace Content
========================

In the documents section of a workspace the sidebar presents the content of the current workspace in a similar way a file browser on your computer does.
This enables you to get an overview over the content of your workspace.

To improve organization there are several display options to group, filter and hide content objects. A powerful search option also helps to find special objects in even large workspaces within a few seconds.

Besides display functionality the sidebar also offers a lot of batch actions and other functionality:

.. contents::
    :depth: 1
    :local:
