Image
-----------

An Image object in Quaive is used for uploading image files (JPG, GIF, PNG) so that you can insert them into Quaive documents or just have them stored in your workspace.

When uploading an image a preview is generated automatically to make it easy for you to find your images within the workspace.


How to upload an image
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Images can either be created as described in the section "How to create a document" or - as files - simply uploaded.
As the method to create an image object is almost the same as for documents we will take a closer look at the uploading method here.

When looking at the sidebar within a workspace or a folder in document section, you can find an upload area below the list of content.

.. image::  ../images/create-image-1.png

This area is used to upload an image (or also a file). To do this you have two possibilities:
You can either click the link within the drop area and select an image via the opening file browser

.. image::  ../images/create-image-2.png

Or you can just add image(s) by dragging the image(s) you want to add from the file browser of your computer over the drop area

.. image::  ../images/create-image-3.png

Both actions have the same effect, the image (or if more were selected images) is queued for upload below the upload area and you can watch the upload process of several objects easily.

.. image::  ../images/create-image-4.png

After the upload process has finished, the image occurs in the list of object in the sidebar.
To view the image, simply click on the list entry and the image is opened in the main content area.

-----------
File
-----------

A File in Quaive is one of the most powerful objects as it can hold any kind of binary file you wish to upload with the intent to be downloaded by your site visitors. Common examples are PDFs, Word Documents, Excel tables and spreadsheets.
For the uploaded file a preview is generated automatically to give the user an idea of what the file is about.

There is also the possibility to have version management for files in Quaive. This is a powerful method to view and even restore older versions of a file and also get an overview over the versions in a table like version history view.
