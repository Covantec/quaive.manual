Workspaces
==========

In a Quaive site workspaces are the key elements or areas to create, organize and share content.
Workspaces represent projects or working units where the users that work on these projects are members of the workspace and collaborate togeter by creating and editing content.

Workspaces can be used as simple folders to just store data that belongs to a specific project. But they can also be used in a very powerful way by drafting a timeline with the workspace's built in events, creating different tasks to describe what to do and assign them to the workspace members and even watch what's going on in the workspace by looking at the social stream and the information about activities performed over the time.

In this chapter of the manual we will take a closer look at Quaive's workspaces and how you can use them. All sections of a workspace, content elements and subsystems will be treated here.

All workspaces in a Quaive site can be accessed in the Workspaces section. To get there please use the navigation link in the main menu called "Workspaces".

This opens the workspaces overview page. Here you can get an overview over all workspaces currently existing in the Quaive site and you have the necessary permissions to see.
The workspaces are displayed as coloured tiles with their title and - if existing - a short description of what they are about.
