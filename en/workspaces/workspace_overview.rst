Overview
===================

In this section of the manual you will create your first demo workspace.
Then we will take a closer look at the different sections of this workspace.

-------------------------
Create a workspace
-------------------------

On the workspaces overview page that was shown on the Workspaces page of this manual, you can find a plus icon above the list of existing workspaces.

**Note:** If you cannot see the plus icon the user you are using does not have the necessary permissions to create workspaces within the Quaive portal. Please ask your site administrator to grant you the necessary permissions.

After clicking the plus icon, a form opens for creating the new workspace

Fill in a title and - if wanted - a short description what this workspace is about.
The pulldown below the description textarea is about the security settings of the workspace.
For this first workspace we will use the default value for the security settings and so will create a self-managed, private workspace.

**Note:** You can see the different options when looking at the pulldown values and can get information about the different security policies and their effects on the workspace accessibility when selecting them. For more information on security policies please take a look here: :ref:`workspace-settings-security-label`

Then click "Create workspace" to finally create your first workspace.

When entering a workspace you can see a set of icons in the coloured vertical bar on the left of the page. This is the section navigation of the workspace and the icons represent the different sections of the workspace. Clicking them opens the sidebar, a vertical panel for the selected section.
