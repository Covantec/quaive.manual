Workspaces
==========

In a Quaive site workspaces are the key areas for creating, organizing and sharing content.
Workspaces represent projects or working units where the users that work on these projects are members of the workspace and collaborate by creating and editing content.

A very important aspect of workspaces is the security model that ensures that all content is only visible to those users who are supposed to see it.

In the most simple use-case, workspaces can be treated as folders for storing data that belongs to a specific project. But they provide many more powerful aspects, such as built-in events that will appear in the workspace calendar and the possibility to create and assigns tasks. All actions that happen in the workspace automatically appear in the social stream, where they can be commented on by the workspace members.

In this chapter of the manual we will take a closer look at Quaive's workspaces and how you can use them. All sections of a workspace, content elements and subsystems will be treated here.

All workspaces in a Quaive site can be accessed in the Workspaces section. To get there please use the navigation link in the main menu called "Workspaces".

This opens the workspaces overview page. Here you can get an overview over all workspaces currently existing in the Quaive site and you have the necessary permissions to see.
The workspaces are displayed as coloured tiles with their title and - if existing - a short description of what they are about.
