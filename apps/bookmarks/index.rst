Bookmarks
=========

.. versionadded:: 1.2

The bookmark app takes care of providing the best way to find the documents you care about.

The app provides you convenient groupings for your bookmarks:

- by first letter (the default one)
- by workspace
- by document creation date
- by bookmarking date

Your bookmarking experience is enhanced by the tabs that provide
alternatives views that focus on subsets of documents.

We currently have the following:

- All bookmarks (the default one)
- Apps
- Workspaces
- People
- Documents

Convenients tiles are provided for your dashboard.
You can have bookmark tiles:

- For all your bookmarked documents (the tile provides a search filter and a most popular bookmarks tab)
- For all your bookmarked workspaces
- For all your bookmarked apps
