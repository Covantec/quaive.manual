"In the most simple use-case, workspaces can be treated as folders for "
"storing data that belongs to a specific project. But they provide many "
"more powerful aspects, such as built-in events that will appear in the "
"workspace calendar and the possibility to create and assigns tasks. All "
"actions that happen in the workspace automatically appear in the social "
"stream, where they can be commented on by the workspace members."
