msgid "Dashboard news tile"
msgstr ""

#: ../news.rst:16
msgid "As a user, when you open the dashboard page you're greeted with a short news listing. The listing is expandable. It only shows news items you personally have not read before."
msgstr ""

#: ../news.rst:21
msgid "Some news items are \"must read\". Those will remain visible for you as a user, in the top of the dashboard news tile, until you've marked them as read. Otherwise the news listing here is sorted by publication date, with the most recent items on top."
msgstr ""

#: ../news.rst:25
msgid "There's a little button to mark a news item as read, directly from the news listing. Alternatively, you can click on an item and read the full news page for that item. This will also register that you have read the news item, and it will disappear from the dashboard news listing."

msgid "The main entry point to consume news is the news magazine, which is accessible via the sidewide toplevel navigation."
msgstr ""

#: ../news.rst:39
msgid "The magazine main column opens with a big leader item, and then continues with less prominent news items and a long list of items. From top to bottom and left to right, the sequence of items shown is determined by *effective date* i.e. the publication date, with the most recently published news item on top."
msgstr ""

#: ../news.rst:45
msgid "The right column shows a list of *trending* news items. For each news item, the system keeps track of when each user first read that item. The trending column shows those items that have been read for the first time, by most users, in the past 14 days, with the most popular news item on top."

#: ../news.rst:50
msgid "To avoid duplication with the main magazine column, the first four news item in the main magazine will not be shown in the trending column, even if they are very popular."

#: ../news.rst:54
msgid "The news magazine has a *section navigation* that allows you to read only news items within that section."
msgstr ""

#: ../news.rst:57
msgid "Only published news items are shown, even if you're logged in as a news editor. If you are logged in as a news editor, there's a pencil icon on each news item that will take you directly to the editing view for that news item, in the news publisher app."

msgstr ""

#: ../news.rst:70
msgid "In the news publisher, the left sidebar always shows you all active news items, grouped per section. Initially this shows 5 news items per section, sorted with the most recently created news items on top. You can load more items per section. You can also completely collapse a section so it only shows the section title."
msgstr ""

#: ../news.rst:75
msgid "You can edit a section via the cogwheel icon, and add new sections via the plus icon. You can select whether to hide or display the section description on the magazine page for that section.
