"An intranet that is empty is not very enticing. You may want to set up "
"some initial structure and content to welcome your users."

msgid "Library"
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/create_initial_content.rst:13
msgid ""
"The Library is intended to provide all the information that is relevant "
"for everybody in the organisation. Put here all the data that you "
"normally share through a file share, a mapped drive, a server directory "
"etc."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/create_initial_content.rst:15
msgid ""
"Quaive Library does not use node pages for every section, so you don't "
"have to create a \"Welcome to Section X\" page in every section. Instead "
"the library shows directly sections and subsections on the first glance. "
"This makes it quick to navigate."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/create_initial_content.rst:19
msgid ""
"So create some initial sections for the documents most used in your "
"organisation. The first one could be a section for the new social "
"intranet, where you put documents about Quaive, about the on boarding "
"process and background facts for users to look up. Another section could "
"be the one for all the different forms needed to do travel expenses."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/create_initial_content.rst:21
msgid ""
"Remember: The structure used on your file share is not necessarily the "
"same structure that users use to search for content. This might be a good"
" chance to rethink and to redo the structure, to make it more flat and to"
" ask your users where they would expect to find items."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/create_initial_content.rst:23
msgid ""
"Another approach that helps retrieving information is the search. Use the"
" library search to look for content only within the library. As you can "
"see previews of the result documents right away, finding the right "
"document will be quicker than before."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/create_initial_content.rst:25
msgid ""
"And there are tags. You can tag all your documents in the library cms. If"
" you have to stick to one structure but you want to also make information"
" available by another criterion, use tags."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/create_initial_content.rst:27
msgid ""
"Example: Your structure is strictly built by department, and every "
"department has order forms, then tagging them with the tag 'order form' "
"makes it easy to locate all order forms - company wide."

"The Plone Intranet project started life as a discussion between Netsight "
"and Cosent back in 2013. Like a number of Plone companies, Netsight had "
"already been working on intranet projects for some years, starting with a"
" bespoke intranet for Belron in 2007. In more recent years Netsight saw "
"the need to componentise their offering to improve manageability of the "
"code base, to make supporting their solutions easier, and to help remain "
"competitive in the marketplace (re-selling existing code was becoming a "
"necessity)."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/history.rst:12
msgid ""
"The idea behind this project is to build upon a number of existing "
"packages out there in the Plone world that provide intranet-like "
"functionality. Over the years many products have been developed, often "
"inside individual organisations, with much repetition."
msgstr ""

#: ../getting_started/history.rst:14
msgid ""
"At the 2013 Plone Conference an open space session indicated that there "
"were a number of other Plone companies with a similar history to "
"Netsight’s in the intranet marketplace. With the growth of the "
"intranet/digital workplace industry, it became clear that a number of "
"Plone companies saw an opportunity to commercialise on a common Plone-"
"based intranet solution. These discussions continued with other Plone "
"community members which lead to the organisation of the first Plone "
"Intranet summit in November 2013, and the formation of the Plone Intranet"
" Consortium, which was later renamed into Quaive_."

"An in-person meeting was arranged to follow up and brainstorm on these "
