"The Plone Intranet project started life as a discussion between Netsight "
"and Cosent back in 2013. Like a number of Plone companies, Netsight had "
"already been working on intranet projects for some years, starting with a"
" bespoke intranet for Belron in 2007. In more recent years Netsight saw "
"the need to componentise their offering to improve manageability of the "
"code base, to make supporting their solutions easier, and to help remain "
"competitive in the marketplace (re-selling existing code was becoming a "
"necessity)."

"The idea behind this project is to build upon a number of existing "
"packages out there in the Plone world that provide intranet-like "
"functionality. Over the years many products have been developed, often "
"inside individual organisations, with much repetition."

"At the 2013 Plone Conference an open space session indicated that there "
"were a number of other Plone companies with a similar history to "
"Netsight’s in the intranet marketplace. With the growth of the "
"intranet/digital workplace industry, it became clear that a number of "
"Plone companies saw an opportunity to commercialise on a common Plone-"
"based intranet solution. These discussions continued with other Plone "
"community members which lead to the organisation of the first Plone "
"Intranet summit in November 2013, and the formation of the Plone Intranet"
" Consortium, which was later renamed into Quaive_."

"An in-person meeting was arranged to follow up and brainstorm on these "
